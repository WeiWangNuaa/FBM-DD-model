The MATLAB code (recommended for MATLAB 2023b and newer versions) generates simulation data for FBM-DD models.
The main files generate various statistics such as MSD, MSI, ACVF, and PDF. 
Additionally, single trajectory for MN-FBM-DD, RL-FBM-DD, and LE-FBM-DD can be generated using the files: generate_sample_MN.m, generate_sample_levy.m, and generate_sample_LE.m. 
The diffusing diffusivity is computed by the file diffusing_diffusivity.m.
